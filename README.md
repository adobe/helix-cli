The Helix Command Line Interface allows web developers to create, develop, and deploy digital experiences using Project Helix

## Installation

Install `hlx` as a global command. You need Node 8 or newer.

```bash
$ npm install -g @adobe/helix-cli
```

## Example Projects

There is one example project in `/prototypes/petridish/examples/soupdemo`

```bash
$ cd ../petridish/examples/soupdemo
$ ./setup.sh
$ hlx up
```

And another one right here:

```bash
$ cd test/integration
$ git init &&  git add -A && git commit -m "inital commit"
$ hlx up
```

## Quick Start

```bash
$ hlx --help
hlx <cmd> [args]

Commands:
  hlx init <name> [dir]  Initialize the project structure           [aliases: i]
  hlx build              Compile the template functions and build package
                                                                    [aliases: b]
  hlx deploy             Deploy packaged functions to Adobe I/O runtime
                                                                    [aliases: d]
  hlx perf               Test performance                           [aliases: p]

Options:
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
```

## Setting up a project

```bash
$ hlx init <my-cool-project>
```

## Starting development

```bash
$ cd <my-cool-project>
$ hlx up
```

Just change contents in your project directory and reload `http://localhost:3000` to see the results.

## (Optional) Build artifacts

```bash
# In <my-cool-project>
$ hlx build
```

## (Optional) Test functions

```bash
# In <my-cool-project>
$ hlx test
```

## (Optional) Deploy to Adobe I/O Runtime

```bash
# In <my-cool-project>
$ hlx deploy --no-auto --wsk-namespace <your-namespace> --wsk-auth <your-key>
```

Instead of passing `--wsk-auth` as a command line option, you can also set the `HLX_WSK_AUTH` environment variable.

## (Optional) Publish your Site

```bash
# In <my-cool-project>
$ hlx strain --fastly-auth <key> --fastly-namespace <serviceid>

### Directory Index

The default behavior for directory indexes is to load `index.html` when requesting a path ending with `/`,
so that `/foo/bar/` becomes `/foo/bar/index.html`. This setting can be overwritten in `.hlx/strains.yaml`
by adding an `index` property:

```yaml
- strain:
    name: default
    code: /hlx/default/git-github-com-adobe-helix-cli-git--dirty--
    index: README.html
    content:
      repo: helix-cli
      ref: master
      owner: adobe
```

### Static Content Handling

During `hlx build`, the static files are copied into `.hlx/dist`. The static files originate either
from a `src/**/static` directory, or are generated by the packager. The exact details are not defined
yet and might change in future versions. Example of static files are stylesheets, clientside javascripts,
 icons, web fonts, etc. 

The static content that is neither authored content nor code are made available through different 
methods to the CDN by distribution handlers. The distribution handler can be selected during deploy time
using the `--static-content` option. eg: `hlx deploy --static-content=github`. By default, all resources
below `/dist/` are treated as static content. 

#### none

`--static-content=none` : Disables any special static content handling.

#### bundled

`--static-content=bundled`: This is the (questionable) default. The static content files are
included into the package of the main (`html.zip`) action and subsequently served via openwhisk,
_abusing_ the main action as file server: 

```
$ hlx deploy --static-content=bundled
⏳  preparing package .hlx/build/git-github-com-adobe-hlxtest-git--master--html.zip:
    - package.json
    - main.js
    - server.js
    - dist/favicon.ico
    - dist/bootstrap.min.css
    - dist/style.css
    33037 total bytes
```

In contrast to the normal deployment of actions, the handler also includes the static
files, as well as a [`server.js`](src/openwhisk/server.js) which is used as entry function for the action. depending on the
requested path, either the static file is served, or the normal function is executed.

#### github

`--static-content=github`: The static content files are pushed to github. By default, they are committed
into an orphaned branch, `helix-static`, of the code repository. This is similar to github pages.

```
$ hlx deploy --static-content=github
git@github.com:adobe/hlxtest.git
⏳  preparing package .hlx/build/git-github-com-adobe-hlxtest-git--master--html.zip:
    - package.json
    - main.js

```

After the files are pushed to github, the commit id is written to the strain config:

```yaml
- strain:
    name: ae9f783fcc2039fb
    code: /adobe/default/git-github-com-adobe-hlxtest-git--dirty--
    content:
      repo: hlxtest
      ref: master
      owner: adobe
    githubStatic:
      repo: hlxtest
      owner: adobe
      ref: cc4bb731a4e48b1690a37292e798781c67383f3e
```

Because the strain configuration is available to the CDN as edge directory, the edge server
can directly fetch the static files from github using the respective commit hash (`strain.githubStatic.ref`).

## Matching Strains to URLs

You can define a `url` for each `strain`. This property will make sure that only requests made
to this base URL will be mapped to the following URL, enabling patterns like having a production
instance on `www.*` and a development instance on `dev.*`.

An example configuration could look like this:

```yaml
- strain:
    name: default
    code: /trieloff/default/https---github-com-adobe-helix-helpx-git--master--
    url: https://www.primordialsoup.life
    content:
      repo: reactor-user-docs
      ref: master
      owner: Adobe-Marketing-Cloud
      root: /
- strain:
    name: cd629c5a74d6d60f
    url: https://dev.primordialsoup.life/develop/
    code: /trieloff/default/https---github-com-adobe-helix-helpx-git--develop--
    content:
      repo: reactor-user-docs
      ref: master
      owner: Adobe-Marketing-Cloud
```
