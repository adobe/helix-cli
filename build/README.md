# Binary `hlx` installer

Installer for the [Helix Command Line Interface (`hlx`)](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli).

## Build the installer

```bash
./build.sh [<tag, branch or commit>]
```

What it basically does:

* `nvm use 8` (required by current `nodec`)
* use [`nodec`](https://github.com/pmq20/node-packer) to build a single binary executable of the [Helix CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli).
* use [makeself](https://github.com/megastep/makeself) to build a self-extractable installer shell script.

For details see [`build.sh`](build.sh).
